# BlockDAGs as a Solution to the Blockchain Trilemma

By [Dr. Yonatan Sompolinsky](yonatan.sompolinsky@gmail.com), founding scientist of DAGlabs. 

### Description

Dr. Yonatan Sompolinsky is the founding scientist of DAGlabs. He received his Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His research, which was mentioned in the Ethereum whitepaper, focused on the design and analysis of permissionless consensus protocols. He is the co-author of GHOST (2015), SPECTRE (2016), and PHANTOM (2018) protocols. Dr. Sompolinsky is now a Computer Science postdoc at Harvard University, researching transaction ordering incentives and dynamics. He is a founder and contributor to the Kaspa protocol, a new PoW base layer that implements his research work.

BlockDAG - a technology that can go hand-in-hand with blockchain but also acts as a new meta-technology that challenges it. By storing blocks as graphs while being protected by the power of Proof-of-Work, it seeks to overcome the shortcomings that stem from the linear nature of the traditional blockchain. Project Kaspa and their BlockDAG solve the blockchain trilemma issues when delivering high block creation and transaction verification speed while not sacrificing security and decentralization.
