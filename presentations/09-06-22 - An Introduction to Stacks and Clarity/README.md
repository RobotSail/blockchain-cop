# An Introduction to Stacks and Clarity

By Kenny Rogers ([@kenrogers](https://github.com/kenrogers)), Developer Advocate at Stacks


### Description

Stacks is an L1 blockchain tethered to Bitcoin through its unique consensus mechanism, proof of transfer. Bitcoin has traditionally been seen as the OG blockchain, but a bit boring because you can't do much with it. Stacks envisions Bitcoin as a settlement layer, with Stacks serving as the compute layer on top, allowing us to separate the foundational settlement/money layer, while still having the robust functionality provided by smart contracts.

In this talk, we'll go over:

- What Stacks is
- The problem it solves
- Why build on Stacks
- A code demo of Clarity, a smart contract language built with security and transparency in mind
